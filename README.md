### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Flutter Developer by day, bug-squashing ninja by night**, with **5+ years of experience** turning coffee into scalable, high-performance, cross-platform apps. Whether it's **Flutter, Dart, Firebase, Supabase**, or decoding mysterious **REST APIs** at 2 AM â€” I speak them all fluently (with minimal crying).

I've helped launch everything from **scrappy MVPs to enterprise-grade monsters**, always thriving in **Agile, remote-first teams** where Wi-Fi and Git commits are sacred. I've taken multiple apps from **"just an idea" to "live on the app store"** â€” and yes, I still get excited every time I see a green checkmark in **CI/CD**.

My hobbies include **refactoring perfectly working code**, fighting with state management (**Bloc, Cubit, StreamBuilder** â€” pick your fighter), and whispering sweet nothings to my **modular architecture** so it doesnâ€™t break in production.


Here are the some of app links, which I have created.
